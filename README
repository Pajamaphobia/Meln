# Meln
Meln is a bot that started off as a project many years ago as I attempted to learn php (it's available in it's current form 
on Google Code, with the same name). It has gone through many rewrites. In 
its current incarnation, it's mostly been a project getting me back into programming a bit, and cleaning it up/rewriting 
features to bring its usefulness back up, as well add new stuff (which I've mostly been doing. :[)

It's not pretty, it's flawed, it doesn't even work correctly most of the time. But it's getting there; as long as I could stop 
myself from adding random things.

# Use
* Edit start.php to your liking.
* Edit modules.php to turn off any of modules you don't want.
* start the bot! (scripts coming for that soon too.)

# Todo
* Move to couchdb for data saving.
* Rewrite text processing.
* Fix bugs.
